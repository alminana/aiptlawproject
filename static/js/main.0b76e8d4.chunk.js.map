The Convention provides that copyright protection may not be conditioned on compliance with any formality, such as registration or deposit of copies. However, the basic elements of protection under the Berne Convention must be strictly observed in such a way that copyrights will be protected by requiring the signatories to honor and recognize the rights of all authors who are nationals of countries which are party to the Convention and that the laws of signatory States must provide the minimum levels of protection established by the Convention.</p>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <p>Another principal international convention for the protection of copyright is the \"Universal Copyright Convention\". It was created as an alternative to the Berne Convention for those states which are non-signatory to the Berne Convention but still wants to participate in some form of multilateral copyright protection. Some Berne Convention states also became party to the UCC so that their copyrights could be protected in states which are non-signatory to the Berne Convention.</p>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <p>The differences between Berne Convention and Universal Copyright Convention are with respect to duration of protection and formal requirements. As to duration of protection, the normal copyright protection mandated by the Berne Convention shall be during the lifetime of the author plus another 50 years from the time of\r\n          death, subject to certain exceptions. On the other hand, the duration of copyright protection provided by the Universal Copyright Convention shall be during the lifetime of the author and not less than 25 years after the death of the author, subject to certain exceptions. With regard to formal requirements, the copyright protection under the Berne Convention does not depend on any formality, while the Universal Copyright Convention requires certain formalities as condition for copyright protection.</p>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <p>On the other hand, Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organizations, otherwise known as \"Rome Convention\", was drafted in order to secure protection in performances of performers, phonograms of producers of phonograms and broadcasts of broadcasting organizations.</p>\r\n          <hr/>\r\n        </TabPane>\r\n    </Tabs>\r\n  </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Service\r\n","import React from 'react';\nimport {BrowserRouter as Router,Switch,Route, BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom';\nimport Navbar from './components/Navbar/index';\nimport Footer from './components/Footer/index';\nimport Banner from './components/Banner/';\nimport Home from '../src/Pages/Home/index';\nimport Service from '../src/Pages/Service/index';\nconst App = (component) =>  {\n  return (\n    <BrowserRouter>\n      <Router>\n      <Navbar/>\n      <Banner/>\n        <Switch>\n         <Route path='/' component={Home}/>\n         <Route path='/service' component={Service}/>\n        </Switch>\n        <Footer/>\n      </Router>\n    </BrowserRouter>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\nimport '@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all.min.css';\n\n\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
